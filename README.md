# Leader-classes
Front end of an institution.
the original website: https://www.leaderclasses.com/
I have modified the front end of the home page of the website making it a little smaller than the original one and adding some additional features like a photo gallery, displaying information on hovering and a back to top button. 
The file I have uploaded consists of 4 html links along with an images folder. The main link is home.html [home page].
Download all the files and move it to a seperate folder and then run it.
Thank you,
